Java Programs - 2D Array Operations

This repository contains Java programs that demonstrate various operations on 2D arrays (matrices). These programs cover a wide range of matrix operations, such as printing, searching, and manipulating matrices in different ways.

Programs Included:

1. Print2DArray
This program demonstrates how to print the elements of a 2D array in a matrix format.

2. Sum2DArray
This program calculates the sum of all elements in a 2D array and prints the result.

3. MaxMin2DArray
This program finds and prints the maximum and minimum elements in a 2D array.

4. RowColumnSum
This program calculates the sum of each row and each column in a 2D array and prints the results.

5. TransposeMatrix
This program calculates and prints the transpose of a 2D array (matrix), swapping rows and columns.

6. MatrixAddition
This program adds two matrices of the same dimension and prints the result.

7. MatrixMultiplication
This program multiplies two matrices and prints the result. It checks whether matrix multiplication is possible before performing the operation.

8. SearchElement
This program allows the user to search for an element in a 2D array and prints its position if found.

9. IdentityMatrix
This program checks if a given 2D array is an identity matrix, where all diagonal elements are 1, and all other elements are 0.

10. ZigzagTraversal
This program traverses a 2D array in a zigzag pattern, printing the elements row by row, alternating the direction for each row.
